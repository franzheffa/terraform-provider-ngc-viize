## NGC Terraform Provider Contribution Rules

#### Issue Tracking

* All enhancement, bugfix, or change requests must begin with the creation of a [NGC Terraform Provider Issue Request](https://github.com/nvidia/ngc-terraform-provider/issues).

#### Coding Guidelines

- All source code contributions must passed the CI Jobs, including linter check, acceptance tests and/or unit tests.
  - Linter check will be executed with [golang-ci](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).
  - Acceptance tests will interact with NGC, such as creating, reading and destroying resources.
  - Unit tests test functionality without interact with NGC APIs, such as function tests.

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and readability are preserved.

- Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:
  - Avoid committing commented-out code.
  - Wherever possible, each PR should address a single concern. If there are several otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed to reach a desired endpoint, our recommendation is to open several PRs and indicate the dependencies in the description. The more complex the changes are in a single PR, the more time it will take to review those changes.

- Write commit titles using imperative mood and [these rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), and reference the Issue number corresponding to the PR. Following is the recommended format for commit texts:
```
#<Issue Number> - <Commit Title>

<Commit Body>
```

- Ensure that the build log is clean, meaning no warnings or errors should be present.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You will need to [`sign`](#signing-your-work) your commit.

- Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions; we do appreciate them!

#### Pull Requests

Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [upstream](https://github.com/nvidia/ngc-terraform-provider) NGC Terraform Provider OSS repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) (PR) can be [requested](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.

#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
